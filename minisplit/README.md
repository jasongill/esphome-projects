# ESPHome Minisplit Configuration

This contains the configuration for control of minisplits in ESPHome using the Smartlight SLWF-01PRO board.

- `yitahome.yaml` works with Yitahome brand mini split units which are rebranded unit produced by Aux. Yitahome appears to sell multiple different units; this has been verified on both the [220v 21 SEER 1.5 ton unit (SKU 5242)](https://www.yitahome.com/products/18000-btu-15-ton-21-seer2-ductless-mini-split-air-conditioner-heating-and-cooling-kit-p-5242.html) and the [220v 21 SEER 1 ton unit (SKU 5244)](https://www.yitahome.com/products/12000-btu-1-ton-21-seer2-ductless-mini-split-air-conditioner-heating-and-cooling-kit-p-5244.html). Other units purchased from Yitahome may be manufactured elsewhere and require a different configuration.

- `pioneer.yaml` works with Pioneer brand mini splits which are rebranded units produced by Midea
